Get details of streamable radio stations from vtuner.com and submit to radio-browser.info

This is a greasemonkey script to be run directly on vtuner.com to be able to submit the details of the radio stations.

# Warning
Before running this script, please make sure you are not adding duplicate stations. Always check before submitting. Do not use the inbuild method for calling the api. The script will provide you with the JSON content that needs to be posted (see http://www.radio-browser.info/webservice).

# Credits
Huge credits to vtuner.com for providing a list of the radio stations. 
Thanks to Segler Alex for providing radio-browser.info website as an open platform for radio stations.
Hope this script will bring more content to wide users of the open-source applications created to use radio-browser.info.

# Getting started
Feel free to suggest changes to the script.
Please help radio-browser.info to improve the tags/name/homepage/favicon for the radio stations.
